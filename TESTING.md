## 🚀 Quick Test (5 Minutes)

Fast validation of MAVLink MCP v1.2.3 features.

**Duration:** ~5 minutes  
**Tools Tested:** 15 out of 35  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Best For:** First-time setup verification or quick feature check

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE

**ALTITUDE REFERENCE:** All altitude commands in this test use **relative altitude** (height above home/ground), NOT absolute MSL altitude. The MCP server handles the conversion automatically.

If you modify this test, be aware:
- `takeoff`, `reposition`: Use relative altitude
- Home elevation may vary (e.g., 25m MSL in SITL)
- Never command altitudes below home elevation

Quick inspection test:

1. Show me all battery parameters
2. Get the RTL altitude parameter - if it's less than 20m, set it to 20m
3. Run a health check
4. Arm and takeoff to 10 meters
5. Face north (0 degrees) to orient the camera
6. Fly to lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427 staying at your current altitude
7. Face east (90 degrees) and hold position for 10 seconds
8. Reposition to lat 33.6460, lon -117.8428, climb to 20m relative altitude
9. Check battery level
10. IMPORTANT: Use upload_mission (NOT initiate_mission) to create a 3-waypoint mission going north, east, then back (don't start it)
11. Download the mission using download_mission to verify it was uploaded correctly
12. Check if any mission is currently running (should be false)
13. Return to launch and land
14. Disarm

Execute this step by step and report status after each action.

## 🎯 Comprehensive Test - Tower Inspection Mission

Complete system validation through a realistic inspection scenario.

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes  
**Tools Tested:** 35 out of 35  
**Phases:** 7  
**Total Operations:** 33  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Best For:** Full system validation in realistic workflow

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE

**ALTITUDE REFERENCE:** All altitude commands in this test use **relative altitude** (height above home/ground), NOT absolute MSL altitude. Commands like `reposition`, `go_to_location`, and `takeoff` automatically handle the conversion.

**Never command underground altitudes!** Always ensure relative altitudes are positive values.

### Copy This Prompt Into ChatGPT

```
I need to conduct a detailed inspection of a cell tower. Here's what I need you to do:

PHASE 1 - PRE-FLIGHT CONFIGURATION:
1. First, show me all the RTL (Return to Launch) parameters currently configured
2. Check what the current RTL altitude is set to
3. If RTL altitude is less than 30 meters, set it to 30 meters for safety
4. Show me the battery capacity parameter and tell me what it's set to
5. Run a complete health check to make sure we're ready to fly

PHASE 2 - MISSION PREPARATION:
6. I want to create a 4-waypoint inspection mission around the tower. Upload (but don't start yet) a mission with these waypoints:
   - Waypoint 1: Approach point at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m
   - Waypoint 2: North side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427, altitude 30m  
   - Waypoint 3: East side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426, altitude 40m
   - Waypoint 4: Return to approach at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m

7. Download the mission back from the drone to verify it uploaded correctly

PHASE 3 - FLIGHT OPERATIONS:
8. Arm the drone and take off to 15 meters
9. Check our current position and battery level
10. Fly to the first waypoint position (lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427) and hold there at 20m
11. Rotate the drone to face due east (90 degrees) so the camera is pointing at the tower
12. Fly to lat 33.6459, lon -117.8425 (west side of tower) staying at your current altitude
13. Rotate to face the tower (face east at 90 degrees) and hold position for 10 seconds
14. Now fly to lat 33.6461, lon -117.8427 (east side of tower), staying at same altitude
15. Rotate to face west (270 degrees) toward the tower and hold for 10 seconds
16. Tell me what our current speed is
17. Check the battery level again - if it's below 70%, I want you to warn me

PHASE 4 - DETAILED INSPECTION:
19. Reposition to lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426, climb to 40m relative altitude to get a closer view of the upper tower section
20. Face north (0 degrees) to align with the tower
21. Get our current attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) to confirm we're level and facing the right direction

PHASE 5 - MISSION EXECUTION:
22. Now start the 4-waypoint mission we uploaded earlier
23. Monitor the mission and tell me when we reach waypoint 2
24. At waypoint 2, use hold_mission_position to pause safely (do NOT use pause_mission - it's deprecated)
25. Check if the mission is finished (it shouldn't be since we paused it)
26. Resume the mission and let it continue
27. Keep checking until the mission is finished

PHASE 6 - RETURN AND LANDING:
28. Once mission is complete, check battery one more time
29. Return to launch position
30. Land the drone
31. Disarm when safely on the ground

PHASE 7 - POST-FLIGHT:
32. Download the mission from the drone one more time to save it
33. Show me all parameters that changed during the flight (compare with initial values)

Please execute this entire inspection mission step by step, confirming each action before moving to the next. Warn me immediately if any step fails or if battery gets critically low.

## 🧪 Individual Feature Tests

Isolated tests for specific features - perfect for debugging or learning.

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes per test  
**Complexity:** Low-Medium  
**Best For:** Testing specific features, debugging issues, or learning individual tools

Each test is self-contained and can be run independently.

### Parameter Management Tests

#### Test 1: Read Parameters

```
Show me all parameters that start with "RTL"
Then show me all parameters that start with "BATT"
What is the current RTL_ALT value?
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ `list_parameters` with filter
- ✅ `get_parameter` for specific values

**Expected result:** List of parameters displayed, RTL_ALT value shown (typically 1500-3000 cm)

#### Test 2: Modify Parameters

```
Get the current RTL altitude
Set it to 2500 (25 meters)
Read it back to confirm the change
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ `get_parameter` - Read current value
- ✅ `set_parameter` - Write new value
- ✅ `get_parameter` - Verify persistence

**Expected result:** RTL_ALT changes from old value to 2500, confirmed on readback

### Advanced Navigation Tests

#### Test 3: Multi-Point Navigation

```
Arm the drone and takeoff to 20 meters
Check our current GPS position - remember this as the starting point
Fly to a position 30 meters north of current location
Face east (90 degrees) and hold for 5 seconds
Now fly to a position 30 meters east of starting point
Face south (180 degrees) and hold for 5 seconds
Return to starting GPS position
Check our speed to confirm we're holding position
Land and disarm
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ `arm_drone` + `takeoff`
- ✅ `get_position`
- ✅ `go_to_location` - Navigate to GPS coordinates
- ✅ `set_yaw` - Face different directions (east, south)
- ✅ `hold_position` - Hold at waypoints
- ✅ `get_speed` - Verify stopped
- ✅ `land` + `disarm_drone`

**Expected result:** 
- Drone navigates to multiple GPS waypoints accurately
- Yaw control rotates drone to face different directions
- Speed at waypoints: < 1 m/s
- Returns to starting position within 2m

#### Test 4: Heading Control

```
Arm and takeoff to 15 meters
Face north (0 degrees)
Wait 5 seconds, then face east (90 degrees)
Wait 5 seconds, then face south (180 degrees)
Wait 5 seconds, then face west (270 degrees)
Get our current attitude to confirm heading
Land and disarm
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ `set_yaw` - Rotate to specific headings
- ✅ `get_attitude` - Verify heading changes
- ✅ Cardinal direction rotation

**Expected result:**
- Drone rotates to each heading (±15° tolerance)
- get_attitude confirms each rotation
- Total test time: ~2 minutes

**Note:** Yaw changes only work when drone is in the air (altitude > 2m)

### Mission Enhancement Tests

#### Test 5: Mission Upload/Download

```
I want to upload a 3-waypoint mission. Here are the waypoints in the correct format:

Waypoint 1: {"latitude_deg": 33.6459, "longitude_deg": -117.8427, "relative_altitude_m": 15}
Waypoint 2: {"latitude_deg": 33.6460, "longitude_deg": -117.8427, "relative_altitude_m": 15}
Waypoint 3: {"latitude_deg": 33.6460, "longitude_deg": -117.8428, "relative_altitude_m": 15}

Upload this mission using the upload_mission tool (don't start it yet)
Then download the mission back using download_mission
Show me the downloaded waypoints to verify they match
```

**What it tests:**
- ✅ `upload_mission` - Upload waypoints without starting
- ✅ `download_mission` - Retrieve mission from drone
- ✅ Waypoint format validation
- ✅ Mission persistence

**Expected result:**
- Upload succeeds with 3 waypoints
- Download returns matching coordinates (±0.00001°)
- OR download reports "not supported" (some autopilots)

**Critical format requirements:**
- Must use exact field names: `latitude_deg`, `longitude_deg`, `relative_altitude_m`
- Each waypoint must be a dictionary
- Coordinates must be numbers (not strings)

## 🔧 Upload/Download Mission Diagnostic Test

Quick test to verify the mission upload/download fix is working.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Server must be updated to latest code (with vehicle_action fix)
2. Drone must be connected and GPS locked
3. Drone should be on the ground (don't need to fly for this test)

### Test Prompt for ChatGPT

```
I need to test mission upload and download. Please do exactly these steps:

STEP 1: Check current mission status
- Run is_mission_finished to see current state

STEP 2: Clear any existing mission
- Run clear_mission to start fresh

STEP 3: Upload a simple 2-waypoint mission (DO NOT START IT)
Use upload_mission with these exact waypoints:
[
  {"latitude_deg": 33.6459, "longitude_deg": -117.8427, "relative_altitude_m": 10},
  {"latitude_deg": 33.6460, "longitude_deg": -117.8428, "relative_altitude_m": 15}
]

STEP 4: Download the mission immediately after upload
- Run download_mission
- Verify the waypoints match what was uploaded

STEP 5: Report results
Tell me:
- Did upload_mission succeed? (status, any errors)
- Did download_mission succeed? (status, any errors)
- Do the downloaded waypoints match the uploaded waypoints?
- If there were errors, what were the EXACT error messages?

CRITICAL: 
- Use upload_mission (NOT initiate_mission) for step 3
- Download BEFORE starting any mission
- Report EXACT error messages if anything fails
```

### Expected Results

**✅ If Server is Updated (vehicle_action fix applied):**
- upload_mission: Success with 2 waypoints
- download_mission: Returns matching waypoints

**❌ If Server NOT Updated (still has vehicle_action bug):**
- upload_mission: Error about missing 'vehicle_action' argument
- download_mission: Fails or reports no mission
