## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Battery Telemetry** - May show 0% on virtual/simulated drones
2. **MCP Agent API** - `FastAgent` deprecated, examples need updating for new API
3. **Error Recovery** - Limited automatic recovery from connection errors
4. **Windows Support** - Primarily tested on Ubuntu 24.04

## 🔧 Recent Bug Fixes

### November 2, 2025 - Relative Movement Bug Fix
**Issue:** `move_to_relative` command was not moving drone horizontally (north/east directions).  
**Cause:** Function was not calculating target GPS coordinates from meter offsets.  
**Fix:** Added proper NED-to-GPS coordinate conversion with latitude-adjusted longitude.
