## 🎯 Comprehensive Test Scenario - Tower Inspection Mission

This test exercises **all 35 tools** including the 10 new v1.2.0 features.

### Copy this prompt into ChatGPT:

```
I need to conduct a detailed inspection of a cell tower. Here's what I need you to do:

PHASE 1 - PRE-FLIGHT CONFIGURATION:
1. First, show me all the RTL (Return to Launch) parameters currently configured
2. Check what the current RTL altitude is set to
3. If RTL altitude is less than 30 meters, set it to 30 meters for safety
4. Show me the battery capacity parameter and tell me what it's set to
5. Run a complete health check to make sure we're ready to fly

PHASE 2 - MISSION PREPARATION:
6. I want to create a 4-waypoint inspection mission around the tower. Upload (but don't start yet) a mission with these waypoints:
   - Waypoint 1: Approach point at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m
   - Waypoint 2: North side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427, altitude 30m  
   - Waypoint 3: East side at lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426, altitude 40m
   - Waypoint 4: Return to approach at lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427, altitude 20m

7. Download the mission back from the drone to verify it uploaded correctly

PHASE 3 - FLIGHT OPERATIONS:
8. Arm the drone and take off to 15 meters
9. Check our current position and battery level
10. Fly to the first waypoint position (lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427) and hold there at 20m
11. Rotate the drone to face due east (90 degrees) so the camera is pointing at the tower
12. Now orbit around the tower base at a 25 meter radius, moving at 3 m/s, centered on lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427 at 25m altitude, going clockwise
13. After 30 seconds of orbiting, tell me what our current speed is
14. Check the battery level again - if it's below 70%, I want you to warn me

PHASE 4 - DETAILED INSPECTION:
15. Stop the orbit and reposition to lat 33.6460, lon -117.8426 at 40m altitude to get a closer view of the upper tower section
16. Face north (0 degrees) to align with the tower
17. Get our current attitude (roll, pitch, yaw) to confirm we're level and facing the right direction

PHASE 5 - MISSION EXECUTION:
18. Now start the 4-waypoint mission we uploaded earlier
19. Monitor the mission and tell me when we reach waypoint 2
20. At waypoint 2, pause the mission temporarily
21. Check if the mission is finished (it shouldn't be since we paused it)
22. Resume the mission and let it continue
23. Keep checking until the mission is finished

PHASE 6 - RETURN AND LANDING:
24. Once mission is complete, check battery one more time
25. If battery is above 40%, orbit one more time around lat 33.6460, lon -117.8427 at 30m radius at 15m altitude, counter-clockwise at 2 m/s
26. Return to launch position
27. Land the drone
28. Disarm when safely on the ground

PHASE 7 - POST-FLIGHT:
29. Download the mission from the drone one more time to save it
30. Show me all parameters that changed during the flight (compare with initial values)

Please execute this entire inspection mission step by step, confirming each action before moving to the next. Warn me immediately if any step fails or if battery gets critically low.
```

## 🚀 Quick Test (5 Minutes)

For a faster feature test:

```
Quick inspection test:

1. Show me all battery parameters
2. Get the RTL altitude parameter - if it's less than 20m, set it to 20m
3. Run a health check
4. Arm and takeoff to 10 meters
5. Face north (0 degrees) to orient the camera
6. Orbit around lat 33.6459, lon -117.8427 at 15 meter radius, 2 m/s, clockwise, at 15m altitude
7. After 20 seconds, stop and reposition to lat 33.6460, lon -117.8428 at 20m
8. Check battery level
9. Create and upload (don't start) a 3-waypoint mission going north, east, then back
10. Download the mission to verify
11. Check if any mission is currently running (should be false)
12. Return to launch and land
13. Disarm

Execute this step by step and report status after each action.

## 🧪 Individual Feature Tests

### Parameter Management Tests

**Test 1: Read Parameters**
```
Show me all parameters that start with "RTL"
Then show me all parameters that start with "BATT"
What is the current RTL_ALT value?
```

**Test 2: Modify Parameters**
```
Get the current RTL altitude
Set it to 2500 (25 meters)
Read it back to confirm the change
```

**Test 3: Parameter Discovery**

3. Wait until waypoint 1 is reached
4. Pause the mission
5. Check if mission is finished (should be false - paused)
6. Jump to waypoint 3 using set_current_waypoint
7. Resume the mission
8. Monitor until mission is finished
9. Return to launch and disarm

- Or: Adjust lat/lon for your test location

**Issue: Orbit not working in SITL**
- Solution: Some SITL versions don't support orbit
- Try: Test on real hardware or newer SITL

**Issue: Parameter names not found**
- Solution: Parameter names vary (ArduPilot vs PX4)
- Try: List all parameters first to find correct names

**Issue: Mission upload fails**
- Solution: Some autopilots require arming first
- Try: Arm drone before uploading mission

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Expected execution times:
- **Quick Test:** ~5 minutes
- **Full Tower Inspection:** ~15-20 minutes
- **Individual Feature Tests:** ~2-3 minutes each

---

## 🔧 Customizing Tests

### Adjust GPS Coordinates
Replace these coordinates with your location:
```python
# Example coordinates (Irvine, CA)
BASE_LAT = 33.6459
BASE_LON = -117.8427

# Calculate offsets for waypoints
# ~0.0001° latitude ≈ 11 meters
# ~0.0001° longitude ≈ 9 meters (at 33° latitude)
```

### Modify Mission Patterns
Common patterns:
- **Square:** 4 waypoints in square formation
- **Circle:** Use orbit instead of waypoints
- **Grid:** Multiple parallel lines for surveys
- **Vertical:** Same lat/lon, different altitudes

---

## 🚨 Safety Notes

⚠️ **ALWAYS:**
- Test in open area away from people/buildings
- Maintain visual line of sight
- Have RC transmitter ready for manual override
- Monitor battery levels closely
- Start with low altitudes (5-10m)

⚠️ **NEVER:**
- Test near airports or restricted airspace
- Fly in bad weather (wind, rain, fog)
- Test with low battery
- Leave drone unattended
- Ignore safety warnings
