## 🆕 What's New in v1.2.3

### 🔴 CRITICAL SAFETY UPDATE
- **`pause_mission()` DEPRECATED** - Enters LOITER mode which does NOT hold altitude
- **Use `hold_mission_position()` instead** - Safe GUIDED mode hold
- See [LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md](LOITER_MODE_CRASH_REPORT.md) for details

### ✅ Enhanced Mission Control (v1.2.2)
- `resume_mission()` - Now verifies mode transition and reports waypoint progress
- `is_mission_finished()` - Returns detailed status including waypoint progress
- `hold_mission_position()` - NEW safe alternative to pause_mission

### ✅ Flight Logging
- Automatic logging of all tool calls and MAVLink commands
- Timestamped log files in `flight_logs/`
- See [FLIGHT_LOGS.md](FLIGHT_LOGS.md)

## 🚨 Safety Reminders

⚠️ **ALWAYS:**
- Test in open area away from people/buildings
- Maintain visual line of sight
- Have RC transmitter ready for manual override
- Monitor battery levels closely
- Start with low altitudes (5-10m)

⚠️ **NEVER:**
- Test near airports or restricted airspace
- Fly in bad weather (wind, rain, fog)
- Test with low battery
- Leave drone unattended
- Ignore safety warnings
- **Use `pause_mission()` - IT'S DEPRECATED AND UNSAFE**
