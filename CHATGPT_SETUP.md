## Architecture Overview

```
┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────┐
│   ChatGPT    │         │  MAVLink MCP     │         │  Drone   │
│ (Web Browser)│◄───────►│  HTTP Server     │◄───────►│          │
│              │  SSE    │  (Port 8080)     │ MAVLink │ TCP/UDP  │
└──────────────┘         └──────────────────┘         └──────────┘
```

**Flow:**
1. You type natural language command in ChatGPT
2. ChatGPT connects to your MCP server via HTTP/SSE
3. MCP server translates to MAVLink commands
4. Commands sent to drone via TCP/UDP
5. Drone responds with telemetry
6. ChatGPT displays results in natural language

---

## Step 1: Configure Your Server

### A. Update `.env` File

Add HTTP server configuration to your `.env`:

```bash
nano .env
```

Add these lines (keep existing drone config):

```bash
# Existing drone configuration
MAVLINK_ADDRESS=172.233.128.95
MAVLINK_PORT=5678
MAVLINK_PROTOCOL=tcp

# NEW: HTTP Server Configuration for ChatGPT
MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0        # Listen on all interfaces
MCP_PORT=8080           # HTTP port for MCP server
```

**Security Note:** If your server has a firewall, you'll need to open port 8080.

---

## Step 2: Start the HTTP MCP Server

On your Ubuntu server:

```bash
cd ~/MAVLinkMCP

# Make the script executable
chmod +x start_http_server.sh

# Start the HTTP server
./start_http_server.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
===========================================================
MAVLink MCP Server - HTTP/SSE Mode
===========================================================
Starting HTTP server on http://0.0.0.0:8080
This server can be connected to from:
  - ChatGPT Developer Mode
  - Claude Desktop
  - Any MCP-compatible web client
===========================================================
INFO - MAVLink MCP Server Starting
INFO - Configuration loaded from .env file:
INFO -   MAVLINK_ADDRESS: 172.233.128.95
INFO -   MAVLINK_PORT: 5678
INFO -   MAVLINK_PROTOCOL: tcp
INFO - Connected to drone at 172.233.128.95:5678!
INFO - GPS lock acquired!
INFO - MCP Server is READY and exposing drone control tools
```

**Keep this terminal running!** The server must stay active for ChatGPT to connect.

---

## Step 3: Get Your Server URL

### A. Find Your Server IP

If running on a cloud instance:
```bash
# Get your public IP
curl ifconfig.me
```

Example output: `172.233.128.95`

### B. Construct Your MCP Server URL

Format: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/mcp/sse`

Example: `http://172.233.128.95:8080/mcp/sse`

**Write this down - you'll need it for ChatGPT!**

**Note:** The URL includes:
- Your server's public IP address
- Port 8080 (default MCP server port)
- `/mcp/sse` path (mount point + SSE endpoint)

---

## Step 4: Configure ChatGPT Developer Mode

### A. Open ChatGPT Settings

1. Go to [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)
2. Click your **profile icon** (bottom left)
3. Select **Settings**
4. Navigate to **Developer** section

### B. Add MCP Connector

In Developer Mode settings:

1. Click **"Add Connector"** or **"New MCP Server"**
2. Fill in the details:

**Connector Configuration:**
```
Name: MAVLink Drone Controller
Description: Control MAVLink drones with natural language
Server URL: http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/mcp/sse
Type: MCP Server (SSE)
```

**Example:**
```
Name: MAVLink Drone Controller
Description: AI-powered drone flight control
Server URL: http://172.233.128.95:8080/mcp/sse
Type: MCP Server (SSE)
```

3. Click **Save** or **Connect**

### C. Verify Connection

ChatGPT should show:
- ✅ **Connected** status next to the connector
- List of available tools/functions
- Green indicator showing active connection

If you see **"Connection Error"**, check:
- Server is running (`./start_http_server.sh`)
- Firewall allows port 8080
- URL is correct (including `/sse` at the end)
- Server IP is accessible from your location

---

## Step 5: Control Your Drone with Natural Language!

### Starting a New Chat

1. Start a **new conversation** in ChatGPT
2. ChatGPT should automatically detect the MCP connector
3. You'll see a message like: "MAVLink Drone Controller tools are available"

### Example Commands

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Cannot connect to MCP server"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check server is running:**
   ```bash
   # On your server
   ps aux | grep mavlinkmcp_http
   ```

2. **Verify port is open:**
   ```bash
   # On your server
   sudo netstat -tulpn | grep 8080
   ```

3. **Test with curl:**
   ```bash
   curl http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080/mcp/sse
   ```

4. **Check firewall:**
   ```bash
   # Allow port 8080
   sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
   ```

---

### Issue 2: "Server URL not responding"

**Solutions:**

1. **Use public IP, not localhost:**
   - ❌ Wrong: `http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse`
   - ✅ Correct: `http://172.233.128.95:8080/mcp/sse`

2. **Ensure correct path:**
   - ❌ Wrong: `http://172.233.128.95:8080`
   - ❌ Wrong: `http://172.233.128.95:8080/sse`
   - ✅ Correct: `http://172.233.128.95:8080/mcp/sse`

3. **Check HTTPS vs HTTP:**
   - Use `http://` not `https://` (unless you've set up SSL)

---

### Issue 3: "Tools not appearing in ChatGPT"

**Solutions:**

1. **Start a new conversation** - Tools only appear in new chats
2. **Reconnect the connector** in Developer Mode settings
3. **Check server logs** for connection attempts
4. **Verify MCP server shows tools** in startup logs

---

### Issue 4: "Drone commands not executing"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check drone connection** in server logs
2. **Verify .env configuration:**
   ```bash
   cat .env
   ```
3. **Test with interactive client first:**
   ```bash
   uv run examples/interactive_client.py
   ```
4. **Check GPS lock** - many commands require GPS

---

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:**

1. **Network Exposure:**
   - Your MCP server is accessible over the network
   - Anyone with the URL can control your drone
   - Use a firewall and restrict access by IP if possible

2. **Authentication:**
   - Current setup has NO authentication
   - Consider adding authentication for production use
   - Use VPN or SSH tunnel for secure access

3. **Recommended Security:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Only allow from specific IP (ChatGPT's IP)
   sudo ufw allow from CHATGPT_IP to any port 8080
   
   # Option 2: Use SSH tunnel (most secure)
   ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@YOUR_SERVER_IP
   # Then use: http://localhost:8080/sse in ChatGPT
   ```
